Synthetic Media Recognition using Dlib-VGG16 with Multi-head Attention

Deepfake is a technology that uses artificial intelligence to create realistic images and even videos making
individuals to do or to say something that they haven’t in the real
life and due to this reason deepfake detection models have come
into picture. Since these deepfake models have come into picture,
it was observed that the internet had a surge in the deepfake
videos and images which had the potential to harm once feelings,
blackmail or threaten the victim, these videos and images have
gone viral on the internet thus becoming accessible to everyone
with a smartphone leaving a very pathetic impact on the society.
These manipulated images and videos have put the victims in
a very pathetic and helpless situation due to their speculation
among family and friends, this concerning situation has made the
victims to face serious consequences, including mental distress
and social isolation leading to take their own life. Since then
deepfake detection models have come into spot light to address
whether an image or a video is real or manipulate a.k.a deepfaked. To underline the problem this paper proposes Synthetic
Media Recognition using Dlib-VGG16 with Multi-head attention
to detect synthetic deep-faked videos accurately. The celeb-df
dataset used in the study contains 157 real videos and 795 fake
videos, the faceforensic++ dataset contains 200 real videos and
200 fake videos respectively. Novel deep-learning strategies are
used to efficiently predict the authenticity of a video using celebdf & ff++ datasets. The experimental results indicates 97.07%
of accuracy, 96.49% of precision, 100% of recall 98.21% of f1
score and 92.51% of area under the curve (AUC) on Celeb-df
dataset, 92.81% of accuracy, 92.81% of precision, 100% of recall
96.27% of f1 score and 50.01% of area under the curve (AUC)
on Faceforensic++ dataset.
